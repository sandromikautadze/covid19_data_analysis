# **Covid-19 Data Analysis with R - Overview**

## Introduction

The following is just a short recap that tries to give an idea of the project. You can find all specific and, hopefully, detailed-enough info, such as data cleaning, analysis and improvements, in the *report* file.

This is my **FIRST** project, so it is relatively basic and certainly improvable. Any advice on any matter is highly appreciated!

## Research Question
This project tries to address the following research question: **which countries have had the highest number of positive cases against the number of tests?**

## Learning Objectives 
The project is an assignment from DataQuest. I decided to start it in order to practice the fundamental data structures of R and to have an initial grasp of what data analysis is and how to perform it.

In addition to that, this project helped me to learn:
- how to write a report on a data analysis project (or at least that's what I hope I have done...)
- how to clean data
- how to extract specific information from data frames and work with it
- practice basic git workflow
