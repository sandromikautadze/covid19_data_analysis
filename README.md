# **README --- Covid-19 Data Analysis with R Overview**
---
## Research Question
This project tries to address the following research questions:

 - which countries have had the highest number of positive cases against the number of tests?
 - which countries have made the best effort in terms of the number of COVID-19 tests conducted related to their population?
 - which countries were ultimately the most and least affected related to their population?


## Motivation
The project is an assignment from DataQuest. I decided to start it in order to practice the fundamental data structures of R and to have an initial grasp of what data analysis is and of how to perform it.
In addition to that, this project helped me to learn:
- how to write a detailed report on a data analysis project (or at least that's what I hope I did...).
- how to clean data
- how to extract specific information from data frames
- practice basic git workflow 

## PS
You can find all specific info on the project, such as data cleaning, analysis and improvements, in the *report* file.
**This is my FIRST project**, so any advice on any matter is highly appreciated!
